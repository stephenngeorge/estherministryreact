        Esther Ministry was founded to equip, empower and release people
        into their calling, so that everyone can have their 'Esther' moment.
        Esther was a beautiful queen who stepped out in faith, trusting in
        God and because of her bravery the lives of thousands of people were
        saved. Following the call that God has on your life is not just about
        serving others it is also about living as the person God intended you
        to be. I genuinely believed that I didn’t have any gifts. Esther
        didn’t believe in herself either and it took someone else to prompt
        her to discover her calling. So Esther Ministry was founded to provide
        a practical way to discover your true gifts and skills and put them
        into action for God.
