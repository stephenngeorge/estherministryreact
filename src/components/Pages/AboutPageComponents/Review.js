      &#34;The <span className='highlight'>Esther Ministry </span>
      course came at just the right time in my life. To be honest,
      I probably needed to do it years ago, but this year I realised how much my <span className='highlight'>identity </span>
      was rooted in my work/career and the lies I allowed myself to believe about who
      I am. It sounds like a cliche, and I don't say this about many courses, but this one
      has led to <span className='highlight'>significant change</span> in my life. When you know
      <span className='highlight'> who you truly are in Christ, </span>
      and hold onto that truth no matter how you feel, no matter what others say, no matter
      what the world throws at you, you become <span className='highlight'>confident </span>
      to face challenges and to <span className='highlight'>thrive.</span>&#34;
